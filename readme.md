## What Is This Resource?
This resource is designed to replace 2D text thread looping. By doing so, we can achieve better performance while providing the user with a more visually appealing interface. It's a straightforward tool that we incorporate into several of our projects. It will also serve as a dependency for some of them, which you can learn about in your resource's README file.
